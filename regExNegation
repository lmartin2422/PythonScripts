The caret ^, when found at the start of a character set, is the equivalent to "not" in RegEx.
The regular expression [^a-c] matches any characters except "a", "b" and "c".
Write the regular expression that matches any characters except letters, digits and spaces.
You must use a negated character set in your expression.

# Regular expression pattern to match any characters except letters, digits, and spaces
pattern = r"[^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]"

txt = "  alice15@gmail.com"
print(re.findall(pattern, txt))  # ["a", "."]


# Explanation:
# [^a-zA-Z0-9\s]:
# [^ ... ]: This creates a negated character set, meaning it will match anything not inside the brackets.
# a-zA-Z: Matches all lowercase and uppercase letters.
# 0-9: Matches all digits.
# \s: Matches any whitespace characters (like spaces).
# So, [^a-zA-Z0-9\s] will match any character that is not a letter, digit, or space. 
# This is why in the example, only "@" and "." are matched and returned.
